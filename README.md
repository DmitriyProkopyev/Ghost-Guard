# 🔍 About

`🛡️Ghost Guard🛡️` is an open source password manager for personal use that proposes
a completely new concept of passwords containment.

Here is what you can do with `Ghost Guard`:
- Use infinitely many passwords
- Change any password at any moment
- Revert any password back
- Use unlimited number of devices 

`Ghost Guard` is fully independent and only relies on itself:
- No internet connection required
- No proprietary servers
- No risk of theft outside of your area of control
- No outside dependencies
- User only needs device and USB drive

# 🔥 Goal of the project

`Ghost Guard` is here to give you an ability to manage your passwords inpependently, with no regard to any outside circumstances.

# 💻 Available platforms

```
Windows with .NET 6.0.9 or higher
```

# 📝 License

# 🧩 How does it work?

Instead of keeping your passwords in an encrypted database, `Ghost Guard` calculates them exactly the moment you request it.
Each user has a set of data partially kept on the device, along with master password and USB drive. 
This way, user data is divided between three parts and is only usable when all three parts are assembled together.
